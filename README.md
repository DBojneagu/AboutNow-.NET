# AboutNow-.net-MVC-6
Bojneagu David/Radu Antonio
This is a project using the .net MVC Entity Framework and Razor. The main idea was to build a micro-social media platform, where you could post messages, enter groups, send friend requests
, receice friend requests, accept them, configure your profile, edit it, comment on other posts, so on. This project was done by Radu Antonio and Bojneagu David, during the
Full-Stack development course, by Cezara Benegui. Down Below you can see the Database Diagram aswell, and the Trello page where you can see how our workflow developed.
