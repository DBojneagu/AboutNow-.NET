# AboutNow-.net-MVC-6

This is a project using the .net MVC Entity Framework and Razor. The main idea was to build a micro-social media platform, where you could post messages, enter groups, send friend requests
, receice friend requests, accept them, configure your profile, edit it, comment on other posts, so on. This project was done by Radu Antonio and Bojneagu David, during the
Full-Stack development course, by Cezara Benegui. Down Below you can see the Database Diagram aswell, and the Trello page where you can see how our workflow developed.


# How to start it


You need to download the whole main branch, and after that, start the application by clicking the AboutNow.sln file, and then, you need to create a database on your local machine using the sql object explorer, and after that, you need to go to appsettings.json, and change the name of the database with the name of the new database you just created. After that, you need to go into tools -> NuGet package Manager, and execute the Add-Migration <nameofthemigration> and after that Update-Database. Now, you can start the application and navigate through it.
